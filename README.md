What is jsava?
==============

An attempt to port Java classes into Javascript while preserving the original Java language code's structure and
hierarchy, i.e. inheritance and interfaces.


Technology Stack
----------------

* OOP Layer: [qooxdoo Core](http://qooxdoo.org/)
..* Although it comes with a toolchain, jsava currently utilizes its own compiler script for dependency management
and minification.
* Testing: [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/)
* Code Style: defined in an `*.xml` file that can be obtained upon request


Standards and Patterns
----------------------

### General

* The main objective is to preserve the original Java implementation as closely as possible.
* To keep the code consistent, the following rules shall be followed.
..* However, this list is subject to change.
* If any situation not covered in these rules is encountered, existing code shall be looked at for examples and new
patterns be documented.

### Naming conventions

1. All names shall follow the original Java name pattern, not the qooxdoo pattern.
2. For conflicting names (e.g. property `size` and method `size()`), the entity that gets the original name is determined by
the following rules:
..* Higher visibility (`public` > `protected` > `public`)
..* Methods over fields
3. The inferior entity shall be named according to the qooxdoo scheme (e.g. private field `size` -> `__size`). If the
visibility retains the name conflict, the entity shall be handled as private.

### Classes and Interfaces

1. Every method in an interface that takes a parameter or returns something shall have annotations.
2. Every method in a class that has not been defined in a superclass or interface shall be annotated.

### Members

1. Private members may be implemented differently or omitted altogether if not necessary.
2. Every member not initialized with its actual type (i.e. when initialized as `null`) shall have a `@type` annotation.
3. Every member not defined in a superclass shall have its visibility annotated.
4. Members that either currently or permanently cannot be implemented shall still be added and throw an
`UnsupportedOperationException`.
5. No member variable shall ever be initialized with `undefined`. Instead, the correct default value shall be taken, i.e.
a simple `Number` member will be `0` while any complex object will default to `null`.
6. If any implementation -- or its behavior -- differs from the original Java code, there shall be comments if necessary.
7. Inner classes, especially those requiring a reference to the enclosing class, shall be initialized with `null` as a
member (with corresponding annotations) and be defined in the enclosing class's constructor using
`jsava.JsavaUtils.createAnonymousClass` (see example in `jsava.util.HashMap`).

### Exceptions

1. See `jsava.lang.RuntimeException` for an example on how to define a simple exception only capsulating a sub class
with a new name.
2. Since Javascript can only catch anything that is thrown, the following pattern shall be used to catch exceptions
in a similar manner to Java:

```
try {
    // ...
} catch( e ) {
    if( qx.Class.isSubClassOf( e.constructor, jsava.lang.IllegalStateException ) ) {
        // caught an IllegalStateException
    }

    // rethrow non-caught exceptions
    throw e;
}
```

### Comments

1. A `TODO` comment may never be empty; it should always contain what the comment is about.
