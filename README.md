Porting Java to Javascript

## Description

JsAva (upper-case spelling & pronounciation yet to be defined :)) is an attempt to port Java base classes into Javascript. The OOP framework in use is [qooxdoo](http://qooxdoo.org/) as it allows most of the required features (inheritance, interfaces, â€¦).

JsAva is experimental and a toy project.
