Porting Java to Javascript

## Description

JsAva (upper-case spelling & pronounciation yet to be defined :)) is an attempt to port Java base classes into Javascript. The OOP framework in use is [qooxdoo](http://qooxdoo.org/) as it allows most of the required features (inheritance, interfaces, â€¦).

JsAva is experimental and a toy project. Most of the infrastructure (especially tests) is yet to come as a proof-of-concept is the current goal.
